Welcome to the Diffusion Gallery!

This is a special gallery where the guests inspire the art. There is just one problem, the gallerist forgot to put up the signs! Help the gallerist figure out who has inspired the art and put correct sign next to the painting.

Game flow:
* Each player enters a question that that will be asked in the game
* The first question from the step above is posed to all players
* The players see a gallery with the images generated from each player
* The players guess who 'painted' each painting by assigning name tags
* The guesses and the correct answer is provided for one image at the time
